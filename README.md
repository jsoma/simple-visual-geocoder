## Batch geocode CSV files _on your own machine_ using the Census API

Geocoding is a pain in the neck. If you're just looking at US addresses, though, Simple Visual Geocoder is here to help! **Latitude and longitude are on the way.**

Simple Visual Geocoder takes in CSV files and geocodes them with the [Census Bureau's Batch Geocoding service](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3894452-Census-Geocoding-Services-API.html) - **all without knowing Python or using the command line!**

It's more or less a very thin later on top of the LA Times' [Census Batch Geocoder](https://github.com/datadesk/python-censusbatchgeocoder), with the addition of a few simple tools to help you break out street addresses and city names.

As a fun bonus, you don't need to upload your data into ðŸŒª THE CLOUD ðŸŒª.

## Using Simple Visual Geocoder

### Downloading

You can download the latest release [from GitHub](https://github.com/jsoma/simple-visual-geocoder/releases/latest) - just pick the one that's appropriate for your system.

### Simple How-To

1. Click `Browse...` to select your file
2. Pick your columns that contain address, city, state and zipcode (state and zipcode are optional)
3. Click `Geocode` button, pick a destination for your new geocoded data
4. Wait and wait and wait (don't worry, it isn't frozen!)
5. A brand-new CSV file shows up, full of latitudes and longitudes!
6. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### How long does it take?

It's a mystery to me, but it took a little under ten minutes for the 3000-row `schools.csv` file.

### Cleaning your data with "Adjustments"

The Census Bureau requires you do split `address`, `city`, `state`, and `zipcode` into separate fields. But what if your addresses aren all in one column and  look like this?

```
540 Streetsway Avenue, Townsville, NC
101 Rock and Roll St, Apt 3, Guitar City, NV
```

Oh no! Do we need to split it apart? Do we need to get rid of that apartment? No! No! **Don't worry, Simple Visual Geocoder is here!** It has built-in data cleaning tools called Adjustments to make splitting long addresses up easy.

When you pick your column for `address` you can add an Adjustment: "Split up the _big long full address_ according to the commas, and only give me the _first section_." That would give us `540 Streetsway Avenue ` and `101 Rock and Roll St`.

You can also pluck out the states from the end by saying "Split it up by commas and give me the _last_ piece." `NC` and `NV`, delivered to your doorstep.

There are options to use this on both commas as well as newlines/linebreaks.

### What platforms does it work on?

OS X and Windows, at the very least. It might work on Linux if you build it yourself.

## Troubleshooting

### Help! I told it to geocode and it froze up!

It didn't freeze, it's just busy geocoding for you! It should finish eventually. Just be patient. It takes me about 10 minutes to run 3000.

_At some point it would be nice to implement threads so that this doesn't happen._

### Help! I'm building this myself and it's HUGE!

Anaconda on Windows installs versions of numpy & friends that include something called MKL. MKL is big. Anaconda doesn't play nice with `venv` so the only way I could figure out to get around it was to just uninstall Anaconda and install the normal Python.org version instead.
