## Batch geocode CSV files in a nice visual interface

Geocoding is a pain in the neck. If you're just looking at US addresses, though, Little Geocoder is here to help! **Latitude and longitude, just for you.**

Little Geocoder takes in CSV files and geocodes them with the [Census Bureau's Batch Geocoding service](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3894452-Census-Geocoding-Services-API.html) - **all without knowing Python or using the command line!**

It's more or less a very thin later on top of the LA Times' [Census Batch Geocoder](https://github.com/datadesk/python-censusbatchgeocoder), with the addition of a few simple tools to help you break out street addresses and city names.

As a fun bonus, you don't need to upload your data into âœ¨ðŸŒªâœ¨ The Cloud âœ¨ðŸŒªâœ¨ (well, the addresses go to the Census Bureau, sure, but not the rest of it).

## Using Little Geocoder

### Downloading

You can download the latest release [from GitHub](https://github.com/littlecolumns/little-geocoder/releases/latest) - just pick the one that's appropriate for your system.

### Simple How-To

1. Click `Browse...` to select your file
2. Pick your columns that contain address, city, state and zipcode (state and zipcode are optional)
3. Click the `Geocode` button and pick a destination for your new geocoded CSV
4. Wait and wait and wait
5. A brand-new CSV file shows up, full of latitudes and longitudes!
6. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

### How long does it take?

It's a mystery to me, but it took a little under ten minutes for the 3000-row `schools.csv` file, and a little over 1 minute for the 30-row `schools_sample.csv`.

### What platforms does it work on?

OS X and Windows, at the very least. It might work on Linux if you build it yourself.

## Cleaning your data with "Adjustments"

The Census Bureau requires you do split `address`, `city`, `state`, and `zipcode` into separate fields. But what if your addresses aren't all in one column and look like this?

|name|addr|
|---|---|
|Your House|540 NW Avenue, Townsville, NC|
|My House|101 Rock St, Apt 3, Guitar City, NV|

Oh no! Do we need to split it apart? Do we need to fight against that `Apt 3C`? No! No! We're too lazy for that!

Little Geocoder has built-in data cleaning tools called **Adjustments** to make splitting long addresses up easy. You just pick an adjustment from a dropdown and it'll clip out the part you're interested in.

||540 NW Ave, Townsville, NC|101 Rock St, Apt 3, Guitar City, NV |Use as|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Comma split: first section**|540 NW Ave|101 Rock St|`address`|
|**Comma split: second**|Townsville|Apt 3|-|
|**Comma split: third**|NC|Guitar City|-|
|**Comma split: second-to-last**|Townsville|Guitar City|`city`|
|**Comma split: last**|NC|NV|`state`|

See, it's easy to pick out the parts you're interested in! You can also split on newlines/linebreaks if you want.

Have another kind of adjustment you'd like to see? [Create an issue](https://github.com/littlecolumns/little-geocoder/issues/new) and I'll take a peek.

## Troubleshooting

### Help! I can't open it on OS X because my computer is scared of it!

Try to right-click (control+click) and select **Open**.

You can also go into `System Preferences > Security & Privacy` and change **Allow apps downloaded from:** to be `App Store and identified developers`. You might need to click the lock on the bottom-left corner of the window before it'll let you change anything.

### Help! I'm building this app on my own and it's HUGE!

Anaconda on Windows installs versions of numpy & friends that include something called MKL. MKL is big. Anaconda doesn't play nice with `venv` so the only way I could figure out to get around it was to just uninstall Anaconda and install everything from Python.org instead.
